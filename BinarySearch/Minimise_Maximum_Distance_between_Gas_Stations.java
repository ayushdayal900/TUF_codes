----->> Minimise Maximum Distance between Gas Stations


Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ of length ‘n’, 
which contains positive integer positions of ‘n’ gas stations on the X-axis. 
You are also given an integer ‘k’. You have to place 'k' new gas stations on the X-axis. 
You can place them anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, 
even on non-integer positions. Let 'dist' be the maximum value of the distance between
adjacent gas stations after adding k new gas stations. Find the minimum value of ‘dist’.

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, k = 4
Result: 0.5
Explanation: One of the possible ways to place 4 gas stations is {1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5}. Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas stations is 0.5. Hence, the value of ‘dist’ is 0.5. It can be shown that there is no possible way to add 4 gas stations in such a way that the value of ‘dist’ is lower than this. 

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 10, arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, k = 1
Result: 1
Explanation: One of the possible ways to place 1 gas station is {1,1.5,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas stations is still 1. Hence, the value of ‘dist’ is 1. It can be shown that there is no possible way to add 1 gas station in such a way that the value of ‘dist’ is lower than this.
